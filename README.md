**How to Use**

**To utilize the image classification model and interact with the Streamlit app, follow these steps:**

 1. **Download the Streamlit Folder:**
   - Click on the "Download" button or clone the repository to obtain the Streamlit folder.

 2. **Open with Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code:**

   - Depending on your preferred environment, choose one of the following options:
     - **Jupyter Notebook:**
       - Open a Jupyter Notebook.
       - Navigate to the Streamlit folder.
       - Open the `app.py` file.
       - Run the notebook to launch the Streamlit app.

     - **Visual Studio Code:**
       - Open Visual Studio Code.
       - Open the Streamlit folder as your workspace.
       - Locate the `app.py` file.
       - Run the file using the appropriate Visual Studio Code commands.
         
   3. **Loading the Trained Deep Learning Model**

       - Int the app.py file locate the following code snippet:

    ```python
    # Load your trained Inception model outside the main app loop 
    if 'your_image_classifier_module' not in st.session_state:
        model_path = 'C:/Users/susy_/IH-Labs/final-project/Streamlit/models/trained_inception_model.keras'
        st.session_state.your_image_classifier_module = load_model_function(model_path)
    ```

      - Update the `model_path` variable with the path to your trained Inception model file. For example:

    ```python
    # Load your trained Inception model outside the main app loop 
    if 'your_image_classifier_module' not in st.session_state:
        model_path = '/path/to/your/models/trained_inception_model.keras'
        st.session_state.your_image_classifier_module = load_model_function(model_path)
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/your/models/` with the actual path to the folder where you keep the uploaded Streamlit folder and the trained Inception model.

     - Save the changes and run your Streamlit app.
        
**Note**: Keep this file open while using the Streamlit interface.

**To explore the Streamlit visualization, follow these steps:**

  1. **Open Anaconda Command Prompt:**
   - Launch the Anaconda Command Prompt on your system.

  2. **Navigate to the Streamlit Folder:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the Streamlit folder.
     "cd /path/to/your/streamlit/folder"

  3. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   - Execute the following command to run the Streamlit app:
     "streamlit run app.py"

Please ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed in your Anaconda environment before running the app.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues with running the app, check the console output for error messages, and make sure you have activated the correct Anaconda environment.
